This github was made to show the Mathematica scripts written during the process of solving for the Surface Exciton Polariton dispersion. 
The paper detailing this is "Surface Exciton Polariton" by Hao et al. 
PerovskiteAnalysis contains the code for the semiconductors CsPbBr3, CsPbCl3, and CsPbBr(1.5)Cl(1.5)
ZnO Dispersion was made for comparison with the 1978 Lagois and Fischer paper on the Surface Exciton Polariton.
